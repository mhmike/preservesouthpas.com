          <b>THANK YOU</b> for your interest in our long struggle to preserve our small neighborhood of Orange Grove Place in South Pasadena. There is a large triplex proposed by a developer at 817 Orange Grove Place, and since 2014, we’ve struggled through the City’s processes to voice our concerns about the lack of compatibility of the massive project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Orange Grove Place  is a one-block, dead end street, off of Orange Grove Avenue.
            We’re a quaint neighborhood of single-story cottages and bungalows and a few multi-family bungalows. 
            The parcel at 817 Orange Grove Place faces inherent limitations, such as limited parking on narrow Orange Grove Place, and dangerous conditions using McCamment Alley. The Gold Line runs immediately behind the homes on the southside of Orange Grove Place, adjacent to McCamment Alley.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you click through this website, you’ll find information from the City of South Pasadena’s Planning Commission Meeting Packet (03/25/19) including a Staff Report, photos, renderings, drawings, and the Project History, beginning in 2014. Please watch the videos that illustrate the problems with parking and traffic. Please look at the illustrations of the dwelling sizes (floor area ratios) in comparison to the massive project proposed by the developer of 817 Orange Grove Place.
