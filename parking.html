            Parking is a problem on Orange Grove Place. It has become extremely limited throughout the day as Gold Line commuters park both on Orange Grove Place and on Orange Grove Ave. 
            Public Works Commission identified concerns that the new signal planned for Monterey Rd and Orange Grove Ave will increase the flow of traffic southbound on Orange Grove Ave. “This condition will result in traffic congestion and other safety issues.” (Public Works Commission Meeting Minutes, 07/11/2018) It is likely that traffic will also shift from the signal at Indiana Ave. to the new signal at Orange Grove Ave.
